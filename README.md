# 🌤️ Android Developer Assessment – Weather Login App

Thanks for chatting with us. Here's a small technical challenge for you to show off your skills.

---

## 📱 App Overview

Build a basic Android app with the following features:

### 1. Login System
- A simple login screen that authenticates users.
- Users must log in using credentials stored in a **remote database** (e.g. Firebase, Supabase, or your own hosted DB + backend API).
- No need for registration – you can hardcode user credentials in the DB if needed.

### 2. Weather Feature
- After logging in, the user should land on a screen showing the **current weather** for a given city.
- You can let the user type a city or hardcode a default (e.g. Cape Town or Joburg).
- Use any public **Weather API** like:
  - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
  - [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

### 3. Bonus (Optional, for extra points)
- Add a loading indicator while fetching data.
- Store auth token or session locally (SharedPreferences).
- Show weather with an icon and temperature.

## 💾 Backend

You're free to use any backend stack you prefer, as long as:
- The login connects to a live DB.
- The weather data is fetched via an API.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

Please submit:
- The full source code (Android project + backend if any).
- A short **README** explaining how to run the app and set up the DB/API.
---

## 🕒 Timeframe

You have **7 days** to complete this (or let us know if you need more time).  
We're more interested in how you structure and think about the app than flashy design.

Good luck – looking forward to seeing your work!
